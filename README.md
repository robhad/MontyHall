Comments about the app
-----------------
* I choose to design the app focusing on solving the original problem and 
therefore did not design it to support more than three boxes. Even if it is
easily done it also adds a little more noise for the reader.
* I also choosed to design and solve the problem by creating a game show like feeling, event though the problem could be proven using less code. But then the app would be more primitive. 
* Handling errors gracefully is also not in the scope for this application
